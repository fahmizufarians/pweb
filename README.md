This website is explaining about me and rans cat named Mocha, In the first page i made a navbar with icon for Home button, and Jumbotron for the header with bordered pictures, and another "click here" button redirected to my facebook homepage. under the jumbotron i made 2 grids of contents, 1st grid is an ordinary paragraph and the 2nd is an unlisted list.

In the second page of html written a tables of some internet cat star/meme and a compilation of pictures , also i show a few photograph of Mocha.

Third page is about my social media, i use icons from w3schools.com to use their library to access their icon collection but somehow it won't show as good as they did in examples CSS Tutorials, but it worked tho but i still don't know why i did it wrong like that.

Fourth page is comment form about my webpage, you can only type on the form but currently i don't know how to make your comment submission delivered to my personal email somehow, i still work on it. so for now it is only for a showcase.
